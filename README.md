This repository contains domain adaptation approaches for mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) volumes.
Here is described the details on how the results reported in our paper can be reproduced. 

We presented four different domain adaptation approaches (each one containing its own details):

- Style transfer with CUT. [Here](CUT) to a full description.
- Self supervised approach. [Here](SSL) to a full description.
- [DAMT-Net](DAMT-Net) to a full description.
- [Attention_Y-Net](Attention_Y-Net) to a full description.
