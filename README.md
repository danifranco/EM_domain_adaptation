# Deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation on EM volumes
                                                                                                                       
This repository contains the code to reproduce the methods described in the publication entitled "Deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation on EM volumes". 

For the code and detailed instructions of the four different implemented strategies is available here:

- [Style-transfer based domain adaptation](CUT).
- [Self-supervised learning (SSL) based domain adpation](SSL).
- [DAMT-Net](DAMT-Net).
- [Attention_Y-Net](Attention_Y-Net).

Qualitative results of all methods are summarized in the next figure:
